# c4ptur3-th3-fl4g-walkthrough

Hi in this walkthrough I am going to help you complete the ctf room c4ptur3 th3 fl4g of tryhackme

In the Task 1 named Translation & Shifting you are going to used this website which are really good for decoding text

Website for decrypting and encrypting
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/

Question 1

c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?

This is a simple one you can figure it by the first look for every number you have a specific letter 
0 for o
1 for l
2 for r
4 for a
7 for t
9 for g

So the Answer will be 
(can you capture the flag)

Question 2

01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001

This is a binary language wich you can tell only by seeing 0 and 1

By inputing it on CyberChef and dragging after you search From Binary to the Recipy you get the answer

So the Answer will be 
(lets try some binary out!)

Question 3
MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======

This will be something on the lines of a cipher with the name base since it has more than 2 =

After some tries the Answer will be
(base32 is super common in CTF's)

Question 4

RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==

This is a string in base64 you can tell by looking at the end of string if it has == it means it probably encoded in base64. So you can do the same as the Question above and find the answer

So the Answer will be
(Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.)

Question 5

68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f

This is a string in hex since you can figure it out by see number and letters from A to F which the represent 10 to 15 in a decimal system which we are using in our daily basis

so 0 in decimal is 0000 in binary and in hex 0
   1 in decimal is 0001 in binary and in hex 1
   2 in decimal is 0010 in binary and in hex 2
   3 in decimal is 0011 in binary and in hex 3
   4 in decimal is 0100 in binary and in hex 4
   5 in decimal is 0101 in binary and in hex 5
   6 in decimal is 0110 in binary and in hex 6
   7 in decimal is 0111 in binary and in hex 7
   8 in decimal is 1000 in binary and in hex 8
   9 in decimal is 1001 in binary and in hex 9
  10 in decimal is 1010 in binary and in hex 9
  11 in decimal is 1011 in binary and in hex A
  12 in decimal is 1100 in binary and in hex B
  13 in decimal is 1101 in binary and in hex C
  14 in decimal is 1110 in binary and in hex D
  15 in decimal is 1111 in binary and in hex F
  16 in decimal is 0001 0000 in binary and in hex 10

So After all this can get the answer which is
(hexadecimal or base16?)

Question 6

Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!

This is a easy one not like before it's rote 13 you can guess this since it's similar to an regular text but the letters are changed by rotating them 13 places 

for an A letter you have an N and so on

The answer will be 
(Rotate me 13 places!)

Question 7

*@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX

This is like the one in question 6 but instead of only rotating the number it's rotates the symbols by 47 times 

So the answer will be
(You spin me right round baby right round (47 times))

Question 8


- . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -.

. -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.

This one is an text encoded in morse code you can figure it by seeing only . and -

So the answer will be 
(telecommunication encoding)


Question 9
85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68

This string is encoded in ascii (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) since the website doesn't have any option for ascii I used another one.

The answer will be 
(Unpack this BCD)

Question 10

you for your patience I hope I have helped you with this walkthrough tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0=

This one is a bit harder you have to used more than one cipher to decode it in cyberchef base on the previous examples
1) base 64
2) morse code
3) binary
4) rot 13
5) decimal

And the answer will be 
(Let's make this a bit trickier...)

Task 2 Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls. 

When you finish downloading the attached file on the top right of the task you can open it inside of Audacity. In order to see the spectogram you have to select the spectogram view by clicking the black triangle in the Track Control Panel which will open the Track Dropdown Menu wheer the required view can be selected. 
Here's more information about spectogram if you are intrested (https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/spectrogram_view.html)

Answer
(Super Secret Message)

Task 3 Stenography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

Once again after you downloaded your file you can open your terminal and use the commands to get the answers
cd Downloads (diverse to the directory where you download your file mostly is on Downloads)
steghide extract -sf (extracts the file you don't need a passphrase in this room)
cat steganopayload2248.txt

Answer
(SpagettiSteg)

Task 4 Security through obscurity
Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

Finally Downloading your last file and diversing there in your terminal you are going to run the next commands to find the answer 
cat meme.jpg
or
strings meme.jpg

which both answer the questions bellow

What is the first filename & extension?
(hackerchat.png)

Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.

(AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!)

Thank you for your patience by reading this. I hope I have helped with this walkthrough on completing this room
